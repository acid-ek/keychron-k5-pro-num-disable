This firmware disables the always on num lock light on Keychron K5 Pro (RGB ANSI) - it will work correctly only with this variant.

To install, follow steps from the Keychron website at https://keychronhk.com/blogs/archived/k5-pro-factory-reset-and-firmware-flash

As always, I assume no responsibility for bricked keyboards, house fires or other forms of losses that might happen in your life.
